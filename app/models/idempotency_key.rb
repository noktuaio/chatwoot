# Stripe-style idempotency record for CRM write endpoints (plan §3.3, B-API2).
# The row is CLAIMED (state: processing) inside a transaction BEFORE the action
# runs; a concurrent/retried duplicate replays the stored response once the
# original finishes (state: done). Only 2xx responses are persisted — a 5xx
# leaves the row in :processing so a later retry can re-run the action.
# TTL 24h; pruned by Crm::IdempotencyKeysCleanupJob.
