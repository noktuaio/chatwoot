    # Transactional, scope-safe, idempotent bulk mutation over an array of card
    # ids for a SINGLE account. Reuses the existing single-card paths (Mover,
    # Closer, archive) so every per-card change still writes its Crm::Activity
    # entry and fires the realtime/webhook broadcast — bulk is purely a fan-out
    # over the audited primitives, never a shortcut around them.
    #
    # Policy safety: cards outside the caller's visible scope are silently
    # skipped (reported as failed with a `forbidden` error) — the bulk endpoint
    # can never touch a card the user could not touch one-by-one.
    #
    # Idempotency: each action is naturally idempotent. Moving to the current
    # stage is a no-op (Mover), re-archiving an archived card is a no-op, and
    # re-closing with the same result is a no-op (status guard). Re-running the
    # same bulk request therefore yields the same end state.
    #
    # Result: `{ updated: [card_id, ...], failed: [{ id:, error: }, ...] }`.
